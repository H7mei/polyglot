/* 
javascrit is not have ablity to speak to the internet that is commad from the browser
so we need to use the fetch api to do that

fetch is facade function
fetch is a function that takes one argument which is the url that we want to fetch
and it returns a promise

the promise that it returns is a promise that resolves to a response object 
that response object has a bunch of different properties on it
one of those properties is a body property
the body property is a readable stream
we can listen to that readable stream for data
