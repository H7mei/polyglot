Oh, I can feel it when you're near me
Oh, I can feel it
Oh, I can feel it when you're near me
Oh, I can feel it

Oh oh oh oh oh, you could be better off
I got my heart to heal, oh oh oh oh oh
I can't forget about

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel

We been livin' like a party
Uh, I ain't trippin' if you saw me
Ayy, you playin' games like Atari
Bring it back, i think ya lost me
Uh, she throw it back and get a wallet
Ayy, I'm on track like a trolly
Uh, I'm only livin' I'm so sorry
I'm only livin' I'm so sorry
I will bring you out to the function
Uh,and you could all get into lovin'
Uh, and you been sippin' on that somethin'
Uh, so you be all up in your feelin's
But I'm chillin', it's a given, seen ya do another boy
Or maybe I'm just trippin', just a little paranoid
Baby I been flippin', this is far from unemployed
I know I talk my shit and you a little bit annoyed
But I gotta keep you near me, you a gift from the Lord

Break all the stars falling
It fills the skies up with
Dark but we're still shining
We're bright enough where we are
Where we are

Oh I can feel it when you're near me

Oh I can feel it when you're near me

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
Oh, I can feel it when you're near me
Oh, I can feel it
Oh, I can feel it when you're near me
Oh, I can feel it

Oh oh oh oh oh, you could be better off
I got my heart to heal, oh oh oh oh oh
I can't forget about

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel

We been livin' like a party
